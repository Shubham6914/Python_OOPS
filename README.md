# Python_OOPS

This repository contains **practice questions** on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python. It is designed to help reinforce understanding through code-based exercises only â€” **no theory or notes**, just hands-on problems.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

Each Python file in this repo focuses on a different key concept of OOP, including:

- âœ… **Class and Object**
- âœ… **Constructor**
- âœ… **Encapsulation**
- âœ… **Inheritance**
- âœ… **Polymorphism**
- âœ… **Method Overriding**
- âœ… **Abstraction**
- âœ… **Method Overloading Simulation**
- âœ… **Access Modifiers (Public/Private/Protected)**

> âœ¨ Note: These files are focused solely on **code practice questions**, not theoretical explanations.

## ðŸ’¡ Goal

To strengthen Python OOPs fundamentals by solving short, focused coding exercises for each concept. This helps build a better understanding of how these concepts work in real code.

## ðŸ›  How to Use

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Open each `.py` file and try solving the practice questions.
3. Run the files using:
   ```bash
   python3 filename.py
